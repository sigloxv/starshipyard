# Multiverse OS: Starship Yard Web Framework 
#  
# More than inspired by Rails, essentially a feature-for-feature implementation
# of `ruby` Rails in Go. Assuming the Rails was setup with Rails-composer, and
# came with very popular, but not default, plugins. 
#
# The remaining functionality missing is the controllers and models; which have 
# not been completed because developers have been experimenting with a variety
# of different implementations. 
#
# Leading to two popular paths forward that developers are still not decided
# upon: 
#
# 	1) Implementing the Controllers and Models using Ruby, that is either 
# 	   parsed and translated to Go functions for speed, and portability. 
#
# 	   Or possibly, including the `ruby` binary and using a socket connection  
# 	   or libruby (similar to FFI but faster) based hand off similar to how Rack
# 	   works, for handling the full MVC component, returning HTML ready for
# 	   a Go based asset pipeline, that includes HTML whitelisting, minification,
# 	   and other common pipeline functionality. 
#
# 	2) A pure Go implementation that is functionality and organized exactly like
# 	   Rails. Including not just comparable libraries to ActiveSupport, and
# 	   ActiveRecord, and ActiveController;  but rebuild these libraires almost
# 	   in their entirity in Go, so that controller, Model and view functions
# 	   look nearly identical to their Ruby counterparts. 
#
# 	   Then when the Multiverse OS Ruby VM in Go is complete, re-implement these
# 	   components using Go Ruby, to have a nearly identical developer experience
# 	   to `ruby` Rails while still being able to compile, and all but the code
# 	   exposed to the web developer implemented in Go, leaving only the
# 	   web-developer code in Ruby, with the ability to use inline Go, or even
# 	   the Go alternatives as needed or desired.
